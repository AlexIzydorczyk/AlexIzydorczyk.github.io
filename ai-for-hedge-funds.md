# AI for Hedge Funds Startup Tracker

This page tracks startups in the AI for Hedge Funds space. More broadly, these are startups whose primary customers are alternatve asset managers (hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, etc.) and who are using LLMs in a primary capacity. I originally published this on Magis, my blog, [here](https://magis.substack.com/p/genai-for-hedge-funds-startups). I have moved it to this page so that it can be referenced, maintained, and updated more easily.

In the future, I hope to split out the list into categories, designate public market vs. privates focuses, and so on. For now, I avoid established companies that have launched a new AI product. For web extraction or financial data companies, see this list instead: <span class="highlight-link">[AI Native Financial Data Providers]({% link ai-financial-data.md %})</span>.

ðŸ“ˆ designates a founding team experienced as practioners in the hedge fund industry. ðŸ’» designates a founding team with experience in AI or machine learning in Silicon Valley. Either designation is purely my own subjective opinion based on my personal relationship or reference.

I welcome suggestions, questions, and corrections. Please reach out to me if you can help complete the list. Please feel free to submit additions/corrections directly [here](https://forms.gle/7xvmKY2EBwYtq3hx8).
