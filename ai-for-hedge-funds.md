# AI for Hedge Funds Startup Tracker

This page tracks startups in the AI for Hedge Funds space. I originally published this on Magis, my blog, [here](https://magis.substack.com/p/genai-for-hedge-funds-startups). I have moved it to this page so that it can be referenced, maintained, and updated more easily.

The criteria for inclusion is not yet strictly defined, but in general, I am tracking relatively recent startup who sell primarily to asset managers and who are using LLMs in a primary capacity. In the future, I hope to split out the list into categories, designate public markts vs. privates focus, and more details. For now, I avoid companies that have are established but launched a new AI product or companies focused primarily on web-scraping.  

ðŸ“ˆ designates a founding team experienced as practioners in the hedge fund industry. ðŸ’» designates a founding team with experience in AI or machine learning in Silicon Valley. Either designation is purely my own subjective opinion based on my personal relationship or reference.

I welcome suggestions, questions, and corrections. Please reach out to me if you can help complete the list.
