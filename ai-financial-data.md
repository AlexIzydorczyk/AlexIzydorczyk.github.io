# AI Native Financial Data Providers

This page tracks startups that provide data to hedge funds or to public market participants and primarily concentrate on (a) data for AI use cases or (b) use AI to process data. I have moved it to this page so that it can be referenced, maintained, and updated more easily.

I welcome suggestions, questions, and corrections. Please reach out to me if you can help complete the list. Please feel free to submit additions/corrections directly [here](https://forms.gle/7xvmKY2EBwYtq3hx8).
