Thanks for visiting my page. I am interested in the intersection of data, finance, and systems that can aid in practical forecasting. I previously led the data science team at Coatue and then started Cybersyn, a data-as-a-service (DaaS) company, that was funded by Snowflake, Coatue, and Sequoia. I am currently working on something new.
