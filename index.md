I am interested in data and data systems that can aid in practical decision making and have been recently working on [this](https://magis.substack.com/p/simcity-and-data-commons). You can also watch a video interview about Cybersyn, [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4sa7F6aPxM).

I've spoken publicly at a few events, including [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzsxQnkbh_I&t=1s), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgBB_tHGSrU), [here](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2019/public/schedule/speaker/306343.html), [here](https://www.dominodatalab.com/blog/learn-about-the-future-of-investing-from-hedge-fund-leaders-at-rev-2), [here](https://vimeo.com/491441764#t=00h16m25s) and [here](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/seeing-the-whole-picture).
